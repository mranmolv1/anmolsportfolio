<b>When it rains...<br></b>
<br>She is fond of summer days<br>
I pretty like the winter nights<br>
Let ourselves meet when it rains<br>
When both our hearts will delight<br>
<br>
The rain will come with sweet breezes<br>
With the clouds so heavy and dark<br>
The droplets of its love pleases<br>
The Godly earth when it come falls<br>
<br>
Maybe, under a roof or a tree<br>
Chanting songs that we like<br>
Maybe, we'll be dancing free<br>
From the harmonies of life<br>
<br>
When it rains the earth breathes<br>
The enhales of what it lost before<br>
The shower of its love teaches<br>
The exhale of hate from the core<br>
<br>
I'll be standing with my faith<br>
That she will happen to appear<br>
I believe she will but wonder if late<br>
I'll be speared by my fear<br>
<br>
The nature's strong, the nature's strong<br>
The nature's love's a bless<br>
From what I've born but not for so long<br>
I've been cursed, I guess<br>
<br>
If the nights and rain will tear my soul<br>
From the body down apart<br>
Will still wait for her to be here<br>
Untill my season starts.<br>
