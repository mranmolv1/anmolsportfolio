                <b>The World of my Best Dreams</b><br>
                <br>When I am tired enough I bed down<br>
                My conciousness visits a small town<br>
                <br>Mysterious enough, winds there are untrue<br>
                Although, home for the losts, especially you.<br>
                <br>Healthy and strong, you have that glow<br>
                Not supposed to be, you were meant to be although.<br>
                <br>Proud of me, sometimes you were rude<br>
                Talked to me, you cooked me some food.<br>
                <br>I could not taste, laws of the town prevail<br>
                But I know it was soemthing Gods would hail<br>
                <br>Eventually, I leave unlike I desrie<br>
                Not forever the wind run, nor stays a fire.<br>
                <br>A divine place the town feels like, and angel you seem<br>
                Line another egoist, is this the heaven I dream?<br>
